## Description
To create a simple calendar application that allows users to save events for each hour of the day. The app will run in browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS. 
Used moment.js. 
When the calendar is opened the current day is displayed at the top. Scrolling down there are timeblocks. When they view a timeblock for that day, each timeblock is color coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present, or future. 
When a timeblock is clicked they enter an event. When the save button for a timeblock is clicked then the text for that event is saved in local storage. When the page is refreshed, the saved events persist.
